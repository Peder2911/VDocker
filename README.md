This build currently requires you to provide git credentials, as the ViEWS repository is private.
To build run `build.sh [credentials]` where `credentials` is a path to a file containing your git username and token / password in the format `USERNAME:PASSWORD`.
Note that this image requires Docker >= 17.6.

Just a POC, will update once i write a proper CLI frontend and data management scheme.
